# Welcome to ScanYourPDF!

This is my first open-source project so please, feel free to comment on anything that you think requires to be overwritten! The idea behind this software is to allow anyone to make their pdf look like it was scanned. Project is currently running version 1.0 on www.scanyourpdf.com



# Dependencies

Project requires ImageMagic and GhostScript.
